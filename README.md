# Plant Disease Detection

This repository contains the code for the RFBR project [18-07-00829](http://www.rfbr.ru/rffi/ru/project_search/o_2071350)

**"Development of massive parallel approaches for farmers complaints through text and images using high performance computing"**

Plants disease detection is very popular field of study. Many promising results were already obtained but it is still only few real-life applications that can make farmerâ€™s life easier. The aim of our research is solving the problem of detection and preventing diseases of agricultural crops with the help of deep learning. We collected a [special database](http://pdd.jinr.ru/db) of the grapes leaves consisting of four set of images, including healthy, Esca, Black rot and Chlorosis diseases. We reached over 90% accuracy using a deep siamese convolutional network.

## Installation

1) install all required packages;
2) clone PDD using git: 

```Python
git clone https://github.com/Kaliostrogoblin/PDD.git
```

3) then, `cd` to the PDD folder and feel free to use it:

```
cd PDD
```

## Getting started

At first, to start training your own model using the PDD dataset, you should download the data. To do that we prepared a special module ```datasets```. We load the dataset with grape's leaves and set the random state for splitting data into train and test subsets. ```random_state``` parameter is used for reproducibility.

```Python
from pdd.datasets.grape import load_data

train_data_path, test_data_path = load_data(split_on_train_test=True, random_state=13)
```

In our study we utilized a deep convolutional [siamese network](https://ru.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/siamese-network-bjhmj) to train feature extractor and then applied K-Nearest Neighbours on the top of extracted features. Siamese networks take as input pairs of images with corresponding labels: 0 -- for images from different classes and 1 -- for images from the same class. 

For training we are using a strong augmentation including rotations, zooming, flips and channel shifts.

```Python
from pdd.utils.training import SiameseBatchGenerator

train_batch_gen = SiameseBatchGenerator.from_directory(dirname=train_data_path, augment=True)
test_batch_gen = SiameseBatchGenerator.from_directory(dirname=test_data_path)

def siams_generator(batch_gen, batch_size=None):
    while True:
        batch_xs, batch_ys = batch_gen.next_batch(batch_size)
        yield [batch_xs[0], batch_xs[1]], batch_ys
```

As an feature extractor any Keras model with appropriate input layer can be used. But we created a simple one:

```Python
from pdd.models import get_feature_extractor

import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
import tensorflow as tf

# set the single session for tensorflow and keras both
sess = tf.Session()
K.set_session(sess)

input_shape = (256, 256, 3)

feature_extractor = get_feature_extractor(input_shape)
```

To make it possible to train the feature extractor in siamese manner we developed a special helper:

```Python
from pdd.models import make_siamese

siams = make_siamese(feature_extractor, dist='l1', loss='cross_entropy')
```

There are three types of distances:

- ```l1```
- ```l2```
- ```cosine```

**But only 'l1' is available for cross-entropy loss.**

After that one can train the siams model using keras ```fit_generator``` method.

When the feature extractor is trained, it's time to create a TensorFlow graph for KNN algorithm

```Python
from pdd.models import TfKNN

tfknn = TfKNN(sess, 
              feature_extractor, 
              (train_images, train_labels))
```

For prediction ```TfKNN``` has special method:

```Python
preds = tfknn.predict(test_images, return_dist=True)
```

And finally, to save the graph for serving:

```Python
tfknn.save_graph_for_serving("tfknn_graph")
```
